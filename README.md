# BlackJack

## Project Description
This project simulates a popular card game, BlackJack, in casinos and contributes to improving the existing open-source [Blackjack](https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects/tree/main/projects/BlackJack) program by adding additional six functions.

## Project Functions
On basis of the existing open-source program, this project adds the following six functions to the program:
* Function 1: Ask users to determine the number of players
* Function 2: Calculate and show the total value of existing cards for players
* Function 3: Add double down options for players
* Function 4: Provide buying insurance options for players
* Function 5: Provide card splitting options for players
* Function 6: Show the game results and final scores both for players and the dealer

## Project Instructions
1. Open capstone-project-task4.py to start the program.

## Project Notes
1. Uncommentting line 728 is used to test the card splitting function.
2. Uncommentting line 734 is used to test the buying insurance function.
3. Uncommentting line 736 is used to test the situation where the dealer gets blackjack from the first two cards.
